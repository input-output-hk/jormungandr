    # It is possible to add a max bound to the total value the treasury takes
    # at each reward distribution. For example, one could cap the treasury tax
    # to 10000. Uncomment the following line to apply a max limit:
    # max_limit: 10000

  # if not set there is no monetary creation

  total_reward_supply: 100000000000000

  # set the reward supply consumption. These parameters will define how the
  # total_reward_supply is consumed for the stake pool reward
  #
  # There's fundamentally many potential choices for how rewards are contributed back, and here's two potential valid examples:
  #
  # Linear formula: constant - ratio * (#epoch after epoch_start / epoch_rate)
  # Halving formula: constant * ratio ^ (#epoch after epoch_start / epoch_rate)
  #
  reward_parameters:
    halving: # or use "linear" for the linear formula
      # In the linear formula, it represents the starting point of the contribution
      # at #epoch=0, whereas in halving formula is used as starting constant for
      # the calculation.
      constant: 100

      # In the halving formula, an effective value between 0.0 to 1.0 indicates a
      # reducing contribution, whereas above 1.0 it indicate an acceleration of contribution.
      #
      # However in linear formula the meaning is just a scaling factor for the epoch zone
      # (current_epoch - start_epoch / epoch_rate). Further requirement is that this ratio
      # is expressed in fractional form (e.g. 1/2), which allow calculation in integer form.
      ratio: "13/19"

      # indicates when this contribution start. note that if the epoch is not
      # the same or after the epoch_start, the overall contribution is zero.
      epoch_start: 1

      # the rate at which the contribution is tweaked related to epoch.
      epoch_rate: 3

  # set some reward constraints and limits
  #
  # this value is optional, the default is no constraints at all. The settings
  # are commented below:
  #
  #reward_constraints:
  #  # limit the epoch total reward drawing limit to a portion of the total
  #  # active stake of the system.
  #  #
  #  # for example, if set to 10%, the reward drawn will be bounded by the
  #  # 10% of the total active stake.
  #  #
  #  # this value is optional, the default is no reward drawing limit
  #  reward_drawing_limit_max: "10/100"
  #
  #  # settings to incentivize the numbers of stake pool to be registered
  #  # on the blockchain.
  #  #
  #  # These settings does not prevent more stake pool to be added. For example
  #  # if there is already 1000 stake pools, someone can still register a new
  #  # stake pool and affect the rewards of everyone else too.
  #  #
  #  # if the threshold is reached, the pool doesn't really have incentive to
  #  # create more blocks than 1 / set-value-of-pools % of stake.
  #  #
  #  # this value is optional, the default is no pool participation capping
  #  pool_participation_capping:
  #    min: 300
