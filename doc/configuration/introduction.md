# Configuration

This chapter covers the node documentation, necessary to have a working system.
It covers the network, logging and storage parameters.

## Node Configuration

This is an common example of a Jörmungandr node configuration file typically named `node-config.yaml`, however your's will vary depending on your needs.
Additionally, this configuration has been tested on a *specific Jörmungandr version* and may change with newer versions.
It's important to keep in mind that the `trusted_peers` portion of this configuration will be different for each Cardano blockchain network.
If you're trying to connect this node to a specific network, you need to know its genesis block hash, and its associated list of trusted peers.

## Advanced

### Rewards report

Starting the node `jormungandr` with the command line option `--rewards-report-all` will
collect a thorough report of all the reward distribution. It can then be accessed via the
REST endpoints `/api/v0/rewards/history/1` or `/api/v0/rewards/epoch/10`.

**this is not a recommended setting as it may take memory and may trigger some latency**.

### Handling of time-consuming transactions

By default we allow a single transaction to delay a block by 50 slots. This can
be changed by adjusting the `block_hard_deadline` setting.

#### The following is deprecated and will be removed

If you want to record the reward distributions in a directory it is possible to set
the environment variable: `JORMUNGANDR_REWARD_DUMP_DIRECTORY=/PATH/TO/DIR/TO/WRITE/REWARD`.

If an error occurs while dumping the reward, the node will **panic** with an appropriate
error message.
