# REST

Jormungandr comes with a CLI client for manual communication with nodes over HTTP.

## Conventions

Many CLI commands have common arguments:

- `-h <addr>` or `--host <addr>` - Node API address. Must always have `http://` or
`https://` prefix. E.g. `-h http://127.0.0.1`, `--host https://node.com:8443/cardano/api`
- `--debug` - Print additional debug information to stderr.
The output format is intentionally undocumented and unstable
- `--output-format <format>` - Format of output data. Possible values: json, yaml, default yaml.
Any other value is treated as a custom format using values from output data structure.
Syntax is Go text template: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.

## Node stats

Fetches node stats

```
jcli rest v0 node stats get <options>
```

The options are

- -h <node_addr> - see [conventions](#conventions)
- --debug - see [conventions](#conventions)
- --output-format <format> - see [conventions](#conventions)


YAML printed on success

```yaml
---
# Number of blocks received by node
blockRecvCnt: 1102
# The Epoch and slot Number of the block (optional)
lastBlockDate: "20.29"
