# REST

Jormungandr comes with a CLI client for manual communication with nodes over HTTP.

## Conventions

Many CLI commands have common arguments:

- `-h <addr>` or `--host <addr>` - Node API address. Must always have `http://` or
`https://` prefix. E.g. `-h http://127.0.0.1`, `--host https://node.com:8443/cardano/api`
- `--debug` - Print additional debug information to stderr.
The output format is intentionally undocumented and unstable
- `--output-format <format>` - Format of output data. Possible values: json, yaml, default yaml.
Any other value is treated as a custom format using values from output data structure.
Syntax is Go text template: https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.

## Node stats

```
jcli rest v0 node stats get <options>
```

The options are

- -h <node_addr> - see [conventions](#conventions)

YAML printed on success

```yaml
---
blockRecvCnt: 7 # Blocks received by node

```

## Whole UTXO

Fetches whole UTXO

```
jcli rest v0 message post <options>
```

The options are

- --debug - see [conventions](#conventions)
- -f --file <file_path> - File containing hex-encoded transaction.
If not provided, transaction will be read from stdin.

## Get message log

jcli rest v0 message logs <options>
```

```

`received_from` can be one of:

```yaml
received_from: Rest     # fragment was received from node's REST API
```

```yaml
received_from: Network  # fragment was received from the network
```

`status` can be one of:

```yaml
status: Pending                 # fragment is pending
```

```yaml
status:
  Rejected:                     # fragment was rejected
    reason: reason of rejection # cause
```

```yaml
status:                         # fragment was included in a block
  InABlock: "6637.3"            # block epoch and slot ID formed as <epoch>.<slot_id>
```

* `value` is the current balance of the account;
* `counter` is the number of transactions performed using this account
  this is useful to know when signing new transactions;
* `delegation` is the Stake Pool Identifier the account is delegating to.
  it is possible this value is not set if there is no delegation certificate
  sent associated to this account.
