The passive Node is the most common type of Node on the network. It
is a Node without cryptographic materials or any mean to create blocks.
This type of nodes are mostly used for wallets, explorers or relays.

In order to start the node, you first need to gather the blockchain
information you need to connect to.

1. the hash of the **genesis block** of the blockchain, this will be the source
   of truth of the blockchain. It is 64 hexadecimal characters.
2. the **trusted peers** identifiers and access points.

These information are essentials to start your node in a secure way.

The **genesis block** is the first block of the blockchain. It contains the
static parameters of the blockchain as well as the initial funds. Your node
will utilise the **Hash** to retrieve it from the other peers. It will also
allows the Node to verify the integrity of the downloaded **genesis block**.

The **trusted peers** are the nodes in the public network that your Node will
trust in order to initialise the Peer To Peer network. More details in
**TODO: add chapter about Jormungandr P2P**.

# The node configuration

Your node configuration file may look like the following:

```yaml
storage: "/mnt/cardano/storage"

rest:
  listen: "127.0.0.1:8443"
  prefix: "api"

peer_2_peer:
  trusted_peers:
    - id: 1
      address: "/ip4/104.24.28.11/tcp/8299"
  public_address: "/ip4/u.v.x.y/tcp/8299"
  topics_of_interests:
    messages: low
    blocks: normal
```

Fields description:

- *storage*: (optional) path to the storage. If omitted, the
  blockchain is stored in memory only.
- *logger*: (optional) logger configuration,
    - *verbosity*: 0 - warning, 1 - info, 2 -debug, 3 and above - trace
    - *output*: log output - stderr, stderr_json, syslog (unix only) or journald (linux with systemd only, must be enabled during compilation).
- *rest*: (optional) configuration of the rest endpoint.
    - *listen*: listen address
    - *pkcs12*: certificate file (optional)
    - *prefix*: (optional) api prefix
- *peer_2_peer*: the P2P network settings
    - *trusted_peers*: (optional) the list of nodes to connect to in order to
      bootstrap the p2p topology (and bootstrap our local blockchain);
    - *public_id*: (optional) the public identifier send to the other nodes in the
      p2p network. If not set it will be randomly generated.
    - *public_address*: the address to listen from and accept connection
      from. This is the public address that will be distributed to other peers
      of the network that may find interest into participating to the blockchain
      dissemination with the node;
    - *topics_of_interests*: the different topics we are interested to hear about:
      - *messages*: notify other peers this node is interested about Transactions
        typical setting for a non mining node: `"low"`. For a stakepool: `"high"`;
      - *blocks*: notify other peers this node is interested about new Blocs.
        typical settings for a non mining node: `"normal"`. For a stakepool: `"high"`;

# Starting the node

```
jormungandr --config config.yaml --genesis-block-hash 'abcdef987654321....'
```
